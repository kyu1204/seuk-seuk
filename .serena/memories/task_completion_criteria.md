# SeukSeuk Task Completion Criteria

## Essential Completion Steps

### 1. Code Quality Validation
```bash
# Run ESLint for code quality checking
npm run lint

# Note: Build errors and ESLint errors are currently ignored in next.config.mjs
# This is for rapid development but should be addressed for production
```

### 2. Type Safety Verification
```bash
# Verify TypeScript compilation (optional but recommended)
npx tsc --noEmit

# This checks types without generating output
# Important since TypeScript errors are ignored in builds
```

### 3. Build Verification
```bash
# Ensure production build succeeds
npm run build

# Test production build locally
npm run start
```

### 4. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Verify all required environment variables are set:
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY  
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

# Check .env.local exists with required variables
```

## Testing (Currently Not Implemented)

### Missing Test Framework
**Current State**: No testing framework configured
**Recommendation**: Add testing framework for future development

```bash
# To add testing capability (future enhancement):
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
# OR
npm install --save-dev vitest @testing-library/react jsdom
```

### Test Categories to Implement
- **Component Tests**: UI component functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Supabase integration, server actions
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows (upload → sign → download)

## Code Review Checklist

### Security Validation
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- [ ] Proper error handling in server actions
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Proper use of bcrypt for password hashing
- [ ] UUID generation for file names (security)

### Performance Checks
- [ ] Image optimization considered (currently disabled)
- [ ] Bundle size reasonable (check with `npm run build`)
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders in React components
- [ ] Proper use of Next.js caching strategies

### Accessibility (a11y)
- [ ] Proper semantic HTML structure
- [ ] ARIA labels for interactive elements
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Color contrast compliance

### Internationalization (i18n)
- [ ] All user-facing text uses translation keys
- [ ] New translation keys added to both languages (ko, en)
- [ ] Cultural appropriateness of translations
- [ ] Proper RTL support if needed (future)

## Database Migration Validation

### Supabase Schema Changes
```bash
# If database schema changes were made:
# 1. Test migration on staging environment
# 2. Verify existing data compatibility
# 3. Check RLS (Row Level Security) policies
# 4. Validate foreign key constraints
```

### Data Integrity Checks
- [ ] Verify document upload/retrieval works
- [ ] Test signature storage and retrieval
- [ ] Confirm short URL generation and resolution
- [ ] Validate document expiration logic

## Deployment Validation

### Pre-deployment Checklist
```bash
# 1. Final build test
npm run build

# 2. Environment variables configured on hosting platform
# 3. Supabase production keys updated
# 4. Domain configuration (if applicable)
```

### Post-deployment Verification
- [ ] Site loads correctly
- [ ] Document upload functionality works
- [ ] Signature capture and storage works
- [ ] Email notifications (if implemented)
- [ ] Short URL redirection works
- [ ] Language switching functions
- [ ] Theme toggle operates properly

## Git Workflow

### Before Committing
```bash
# 1. Check git status
git status

# 2. Review changes
git diff

# 3. Stage appropriate files
git add [files]

# 4. Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: descriptive commit message"

# 5. Push to appropriate branch
git push origin [branch-name]
```

### Commit Message Conventions
```
feat: new feature implementation
fix: bug fixes
docs: documentation updates
style: code formatting changes
refactor: code restructuring without functionality change
test: test additions or modifications
chore: maintenance tasks
```

## Quality Gates

### Minimum Requirements
- [ ] **Functional**: Feature works as intended
- [ ] **Lint**: Code passes linting rules (when enforced)
- [ ] **Build**: Production build completes successfully
- [ ] **Security**: No security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] **i18n**: All text properly internationalized

### Recommended (Future)
- [ ] **Tests**: Unit and integration tests pass
- [ ] **Performance**: No significant performance regression
- [ ] **Accessibility**: a11y standards maintained
- [ ] **Documentation**: Code changes documented

## Error Handling Verification

### Client-Side Error Handling
- [ ] Loading states implemented
- [ ] Error states with user-friendly messages
- [ ] Graceful fallbacks for failed operations
- [ ] Proper error boundaries (React)

### Server-Side Error Handling
- [ ] Try-catch blocks in server actions
- [ ] Proper error logging
- [ ] Graceful degradation
- [ ] Database connection error handling

## Monitoring (Future Implementation)

### Performance Monitoring
- Consider adding analytics (Google Analytics, Vercel Analytics)
- Error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket)
- Performance monitoring (Web Vitals)

### Business Metrics
- Document upload success rate
- Signature completion rate
- User engagement metrics
- Error frequency tracking
